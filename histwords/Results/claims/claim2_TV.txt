1. A method for setting an event timer to control a recording device for recording television programs, comprising the steps of:
electronically storing television program schedule listings comprising a time, a channel and a title for a plurality of television programs;
accepting user designation of selected ones of the electronically stored television program schedule listings for recording;
automatically electronically converting the selected ones of said television program schedule listings into event timer information sequences for directly controlling a recording device to record television programs in response to the user designation of selected ones of the electronically stored television program schedule listings for recording, said event timer information sequences including a television program start time, a television program end time or duration and a television program channel for each of the user selected ones of the television program schedule listings; and
loading the event timer information sequences into an event timer, such that the event timer information sequences in the event timer are used to control a recording device for recording television programs corresponding to the selected ones of the electronically stored television program schedule listings.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of controlling the recording device from the event timer information in the event timer.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein said controlling step comprises the step of transmitting commands to control the recording device based upon the event timer information in the event timer.
4. The method of claim 2 adapted for use with a recording device having a recording device event timer contained therein, and wherein said controlling step comprises the step of transferring the event timer information to the recording device event timer.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein said transferring step comprises the step of transmitting the event timer information to the recording device event timer via remote control.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein said loading step comprises the step of transmitting the event timer information to said event timer via remote control.
7. A method for setting an event timer to control a recording device for recording television programs, comprising the steps of:
electronically storing television program schedule listings comprising a time, a channel and a title for a plurality of television programs;
accepting user designation of selected ones of the electronically stored television program schedule listings for recording;
automatically electronically converting the selected ones of said television program schedule listings into event timer information sequences for directly controlling a recording device to record television programs in response to the user designation of selected ones of the electronically stored television program schedule listings for recording, said event timer information sequences including a television program start time, a television program end time or duration and a television program channel for each of the user selected ones of the television program schedule listings; and
loading the event timer information sequences into an event timer;
wherein said loading step comprises the step of transferring the event timer information sequences to said event timer over a data bus, such that the event timer information sequences in the event timer are used to control a recording device for recording television programs corresponding to the selected ones of the electronically stored television program schedule listings.
